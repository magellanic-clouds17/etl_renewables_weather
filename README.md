# ETL Pipeline to enable Forecasting of Renewable Energy Generation in Germany using Weather Data


## Status: Ongoing ðŸš§
This project is a work in progress.

## Project Overview
This portfolio project aims to explore the integration and analysis of energy generation and consumption data alongside weather data for Germany, focusing on the timeframe after 2010. Utilizing both SQL (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases, the project seeks to uncover insights into how weather impacts energy dynamics, identify energy consumption patterns, and evaluate renewable energy sources' efficiency.

## Data Sources
- **Energy Data**: From ENTSO-E Transparency Platform and Agora Energiewende.
- **Weather Data**: Detailed records from the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) Climate Data Center, including temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind speed metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Databases**: MongoDB for unstructured data; MySQL for structured data.
- **Programming**: Python, with libraries such as pandas for data processing. SQL to interact with the databases.
